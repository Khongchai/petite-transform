Refactor list
0. Define clear requirements based on your old code, this is like business requirements that the new migrated library will have to conform to.
0.1 make sure you have a playground where you can import your project

1. Focus on absolute transform first. Define the usage in a testable environment (means you will have to be able to import your shit), then use it!
2. Then continue working on the reltaive transform.
3. Then refine the API.

Why I'm building this.

In a sense, this is not a transformation library per se, but a math library. 

This is a problem that has been solved a gazillion times already, but the problem I see right now is that a lot of zoom and pan libraries out there do more than simple transformations. I just want something that I can reuse in any future simple webgl/canvas projects. I just want a simple math library for my canvas with intuitive APIs. Currently, nothing out there really bring to the table everything I want.
